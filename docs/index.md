# PiCa Docs

PiCa is lightweight and minimalist package for autodiff.

This library is still under development, so it is recommended that it is only used on an experimental basis!

PiCa provides:
- Representing mathematical functions using computational graphs.
- Evaluation of functions
-  Obtain the derivatives of the variables of the function

Contribution:
The PiCa library is still under development, so you may not find some nodes you want to work with. More features will be added to the library continuously, and anyone is free to make a pull request. To make a pull request, it is important to point out the changes you have made and why you have made them.
